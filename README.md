## Repository Description:
This project written and compiled in C-Sharp will initially welcome the user to an instance of Pierre's Bakery in a GUI format. From there, the user will be prompted create a vendor and create orders of breads and pastries for them as desired. Afterwards, navigating to that order's page will display the price of the entire order for all items including any relevant discounts based on a previous program created for Pierre's Bakery.

This project was hand-built in tandem with a programming class taught by Epicodus. It contains use of C-Sharp, .NET, and Markdown. This project also uses Text To ASCII Art Generator linked below along with licensing information.

## Setup Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList". 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
